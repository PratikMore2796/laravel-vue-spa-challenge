## Task2 Description

For task2 I had implemented the form. I got error 401 due to bearer token.
I tried to fetch data using vue js instead of Laravel Sanctum.
However, I got data using postman but it was not much usefull.
It helped me to verify the token and generate the api/results url.
The screenshot is attached below.
